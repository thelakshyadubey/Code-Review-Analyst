Here is the existing code with detailed suggestions:

```
num = 39  # Consider adding a docstring to explain the purpose of this variable

flag = False  # Consider renaming this variable to something like 'is_composite' for better readability

if num == 1 separately  # This condition is correct
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
  
elif num > 1:  # Correct indentation
    for i in range(2, num):  # Consider using a more efficient range, e.g., `range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`
        if (num % i) == 0:
            flag = True
            break

    if flag:  # Consider using an early return instead of an if-else block
        print(num, "is not a prime number")
    else:  # This condition is correct
        print(num, "is a prime number")
```

Here are some specific improvements:

1. **Variable naming**: Consider renaming `flag` to `is_composite` for better readability.
2. **Range optimization**: Instead of iterating from `2` to `num`, you can iterate up to the square root of `num` (inclusive) to reduce the number of iterations. This is because a larger factor of `num` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
3. **Early return**: Instead of using an `if-else` block, consider using an early return when you find that `num` is not a prime number. This can simplify the code and reduce indentation.

Here's the refactored code:
```
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if num is a prime number, False otherwise."""
    if num == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


num = 39
if is_prime(num):
    print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
```
I've also extracted the prime number check into a separate function `is_prime` for better modularity and reusability.
